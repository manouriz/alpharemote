    <string name="help">Help</string>
    <string name="help_settings_connection_troubleshooting_title">Connection Troubleshooting</string>
    <string name="help_settings_connection_troubleshooting_text">On your camera make sure that \"Bluetooth remote control\" is enabled. This is a separate setting that might get disabled if you enable other remote control methods (like IR remote).\n\nThe settings might have different names on different camera models or might be abbreviated like \"Camera Rmt Ctrl\". Please check your camera\'s manual to find all Bluetooth related settings.\n\nIf the camera does not offer pairing because it is already paired to your phone, check your phone\'s Bluetooth settings to remove an existing pairing that is not linked to this app.\n\nSometimes, the IT classic may help as well: Rebooting the phone or turning Bluetooth off and on again.</string>
    <string name="help_settings_custom_buttons_title">Custom Buttons</string>
    <string name="help_settings_custom_buttons_text">Here you can pick the buttons that you want to show up in your phone\'s notification area.\n\nNote, that these buttons only support simple taps, but cannot be held down. Therefore, you can enable a toggle function (tap to press and tap again to release) and/or a hold duration. This is especially relevant for buttons that act as \"jogs\" like zoom buttons. Here you probably want to enable a short duration along with a high speed.\n\nMost of these functions act like the buttons or jogs on your camera, but there are two exceptions:\n\n\"Focus\" is equivalent to half-pressing the shutter button. If you add it as a toggle, using any of the shutter function will automatically release the focus button, too.\n\n\"Trigger once\" will fully press the shutter button and keep it pressed until the camera reports that the shutter has been opened. In contrast to the normal shutter button, this ensures that the shutter is released even if the camera takes a moment to focus. However, the response time of the shutter status for this function is too slow to prevent taking multiple pictures if the camera is set to burst mode.</string>
    <string name="help_camera_remote_title">The remote</string>
    <string name="help_camera_remote_text">In the top-left corner you can see the status of your camera, specifically the state of its focus, its shutter and its video recording state.\n\nThe buttons in the horizontal bar at the bottom are the same that you will find in your phone\'s notification area and they behave in the same way, including their limitation to only support simple taps, but not holding them down.\n\nIn contrast to this, the buttons on the main part of this screen match the buttons on your camera and you can actually hold them. With the exception being that \"AF ON\" is a toggle (it\'s a bit tricky to hold that and touch the trigger at the same time) as well as \"Focus\", which is the equivalent to half-pressing your shutter button.</string>
